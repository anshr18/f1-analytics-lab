F1 Intelligence Hub - Database Migrations
=========================================

This directory contains Alembic database migrations.

## Creating a New Migration

```bash
# Auto-generate migration from model changes
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"

# Create empty migration
alembic revision -m "description of changes"
```

## Running Migrations

```bash
# Upgrade to latest
alembic upgrade head

# Upgrade by one version
alembic upgrade +1

# Downgrade by one version
alembic downgrade -1

# Show current version
alembic current

# Show migration history
alembic history
```

## Migration Best Practices

1. Always review auto-generated migrations before applying
2. Test migrations on a copy of production data
3. Migrations should be reversible (implement downgrade)
4. Include data migrations when changing schemas
5. Never edit applied migrations, create new ones instead
